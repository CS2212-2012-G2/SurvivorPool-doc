The General Panel
------------------------

At first glance, this panel will look very busy.  We will explain this panel from the top down.

Tabs
~~~~~~~

There are four tabs at the top of the panel. Ignoring the General tab (this is where you currently are), we have:

**The Contestant Tab**

This is where the information for all of the contestants. For more information on how to work with this panel, see the section titled *Contestant Panel*.

**The Player Tab**

This tab leads you to the Player panel, which displays information on the people that have decided to take part in the office pool.  For more information on how to work with this panel, see the section titled *Player Panel*.

**The Bonus Tab**
	
This tab leads you to where you will be able to enter new or modify existing questions for your players to answer. For more information on how to work with this panel, see the section titled *Bonus Panel*.


Time
~~~~~~

There are two buttons in this area: Start Season and Advance Week (week number). 

**Start Season**

Pressing this button indicates that you are prepared to begin the game with the information that you have entered.  The requirements to start a season are as follows:

	1. You must have saved a number of contestants equal to the number you set on the Create Season Panel.
	2. You must have at least 1 person taking part in the office pool.

If you've met the requirements, a window will pop up and request that you enter the amount of money that each player will be contributing, and the advance week button will light up.

**Advance Week**

This button does quite a bit.  It will cast off whichever contestant you selected to be, fill in weekly and ultimate picks for whichever players neglected to make theirs, allocate points based off of the weekly picks, and update the bottom half of the General Panel.  You must have selected a contestant to be cast off for the current week in order for this button to work.

*Note: This button will only become active after you have started the season. On the final week, the label on the button will change to "Advance Final Week".  The functionality is the same, it is just informing you that you have reached the final week of the competition.*


Tribes
~~~~~~~~

Here you will see your two tribes names and a "Save Tribes" button.  It's very straight forward.  If it becomes necessary to change a tribe name, you can do so in the appropriate field (note that the restrictions applied to tribe names on the Create Season Panel will still apply on the General Panel) and press "Save Tribes". 

History
~~~~~~~~~

In this field, you can view who has been cast off, when they were cast off, and who is still active in the game.  We also give you the option to select a specific week to view.

**View Week**

You can decide to view a previous week.  It will display the Contestants/Cast Offs tables as they looked on that week.

**Contestants**

This table displays who is (or was) active on the current week.

**Cast Offs**

This table displays who has been cast off up to the week previous to the current week.
