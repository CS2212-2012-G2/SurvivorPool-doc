<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Administration Panel</a></h1>
<div class="section" id="getting-started">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting Started</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="creating-a-season">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">1.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating A Season</a></h3>
<div class="section" id="create-season-panel">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Create Season Panel</a></h4>
<p>This is the very first panel you will see as an administrator.  Assuming
everything is working properly (and trust us, it is), there should be a few
things unique to this panel that you'll notice:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>A spot for you to increase/decrease the number of weeks in this season.</li>
<li>A spot for you to increase/decrease the number of contestants in this
season.</li>
<li>Two spots for you to enter tribe names.</li>
<li>A button at the bottom of the panel that says &quot;Create Season&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="modifying-the-number-of-weeks-contestants">
<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Modifying the number of Weeks/Contestants</a></h5>
<p>We did what we could to keep this simple for you.  These two fields are
synchronized, so all you need to do is set either</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>The number of contestants in your game,</li>
</ol>
<p>or</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="2">
<li>The number of weeks your game will run for.</li>
</ol>
<p>The other field will update appropriately.</p>
<p>Note: These fields abide by the standard mechanics of the game of Survivor.  You
can have no more than 15 contestants, and thus 12 weeks, and no less than 6
contestants (3 weeks).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="entering-tribe-names">
<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Entering Tribe Names</a></h5>
<p>There's a certain etiquette to naming tribes that must be abided by for you to
successfully start your season.  Your tribe names must be kept simple (as simple
as we keep this process for you!). The actual names are decided on the show, but
if you are going for a more personalized game, remember:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The tribe names cannot have numbers or special characters in them.</li>
<li>The tribe names must be less than or equal to 30 characters.</li>
<li>The tribe names must be greater than or equal to 1 character.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="create-season">
<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Create Season</a></h5>
<p>When you press this button, it will check the tribe names to make sure the guide
lines indicated above have been followed properly. If they have not, the panel
will inform you where the error exists, otherwise it will allow you to proceed
to the <a class="reference internal" href="#general-panel">General Panel</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="general-panel">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Panel</a></h2>
<p>At first glance, this panel will look very busy.  We will explain this panel
from the top down.</p>
<div class="section" id="tabs">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">1.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tabs</a></h3>
<p>There are four tabs at the top of the panel. Ignoring the General tab (this is
where you currently are), we have:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">The Contestant Tab</p>
<p>This is where the information for all of the contestants. For more information
on how to work with this panel, see the <a href="#id46"><span class="problematic" id="id47">`Contestant Panel`_</span></a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The Player Tab</p>
<p>This tab leads you to the Player panel, which displays information on the
people that have decided to take part in the office pool.
For more information on how to work with this panel, see <a href="#id48"><span class="problematic" id="id49">`Player Panel`_</span></a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The Bonus Tab</p>
<p>This tab leads you to where you will be able to enter new or modify existing
questions for your players to answer. For more information on how to work with
this panel, see <a class="reference internal" href="#bonus-panel">Bonus Panel</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="time">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">1.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time</a></h3>
<p>There are two buttons in this area: Start Season and Advance Week (week number).</p>
<div class="section" id="start-season">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15">Start Season</a></h4>
<p>Pressing this button indicates that you are prepared to begin the game with the
information that you have entered.  The requirements to start a season are as
follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>You must have saved a number of contestants equal to the number you set on
the <a class="reference internal" href="#create-season-panel">Create Season Panel</a>.</li>
<li>You must have at least 1 person taking part in the office pool.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you've met the requirements, a window will pop up and request that you enter
the amount of money that each player will be contributing, and the advance week
button will light up.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="advance-week">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id16">Advance Week</a></h4>
<p>This button does quite a bit.  It will cast off whichever contestant you
selected to be, fill in weekly and ultimate picks for whichever players
neglected to make theirs, allocate points based off of the weekly picks, and
update the bottom half of the <a class="reference internal" href="#general-panel">General Panel</a>.  You must have selected a
contestant to be cast off for the current week in order for this button to work.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This button will only become active after you have started the season.
On the final week, the label on the button will change to <em>Advance Final Week</em>.
The functionality is the same, it is just informing you that you have reached
the final week of the competition.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tribes">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id17">1.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tribes</a></h3>
<p>Here you will see your two tribes names and a &quot;Save Tribes&quot; button.  It is very
straight forward.  If it becomes necessary to change a tribe name, you can do so
in the appropriate field (note that the restrictions applied to tribe names on
the <a class="reference internal" href="#create-season-panel">Create Season Panel</a> will still apply on the <a class="reference internal" href="#general-panel">General Panel</a>) and press
<em>Save Tribes</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="history">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id18">1.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History</a></h3>
<p>In this field, you can view who has been cast off, when they were cast off, and
who is still active in the game.  We also give you the option to select a
specific week to view.</p>
<div class="section" id="view-week">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id19">View Week</a></h4>
<p>You can decide to view a previous week.  It will display the Contestants/Cast
Offs tables as they looked on that week.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="contestants">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id20">Contestants</a></h4>
<p>This table displays who is (or was) active on the current week.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cast-offs">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id21">Cast Offs</a></h4>
<p>This table displays who has been cast off up to the week previous to the current
week.</p>
</div>
</div>

<li>The administrative user must be able to start the game (at this point no new
players or contestants can be added). At this point the administrative
user should also enter the amount of money that each player is going to
pitch in (for example each player might be pitching in 5 dollars or 1
dollar).<ul>
<li>Upon clicking Start Season (in the General Panel) you will be prompted for
the bet amount</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="15">
<li>The administrative user must be able to add/modify/delete bonus questions
for each round/week. Each bonus question must be 1 to 200 characters long
the question can be either multiple choice or short answer. The answer must
be 1 to 200 characters. The administrative user must be able to list all the
bonus questions in order by round/week.<ul>
<li>This information can be found within the &quot;Bonus&quot; tab.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The administrative user must be able to change which contestant was
eliminated each week, incase he/she made a mistake. However the player can
NOT change who he/she picked to eliminated one the round has passed. If the
admin user change the contestant that was eliminated for a previous week,
then the standings will have to be updated.<ul>
<li>When changing a choice, go to the contestant tab, and click open the
combobox to the left of the &quot;set status&quot; button. This allows you to choose
(after selecting the contestant in question within the display table) what
week you'd like them to be cast off on. If it is the current week, it
proceeds as normal, but if it's a previous week, you will be asked if you
would like to continue, as it would invalidate the game.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If a player forgets to pick who will be eliminated in a week, then he/she
will be given a random contestant as his/her pick for that week (thus some
weeks the player might get points even though he/she didn't pick anyone, if
the random pick is the contestant who was eliminated). This also means that
a player who drops out (stops picking altogether) might end up winning the
pool.<ul>
<li>This is generated when there are no picks select upon clicking &quot;advance
week&quot; within the general tab</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Players pick which of the 3 remaining contestants will win. If they pick
correctly they get 40 points<ul>
<li>This is generated within the backend after the final week's advancement.
This can be seen within the player tab's table, which displays player
scores</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Every week players will say who they think will be eliminated. If the player
pick the correct contestant who will be eliminated, they get 20 points<ul>
<li>See 18.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A player can change who they think will win the whole game at any point,
then they get 2 points * the number of remaining contestants<ul>

<li>All Stages, at any point during the game: At any point during the game,
players may answer additional bonus questions for bonus marks, for example
&quot;Who wins immunity this week?&quot;, or &quot;How many people received votes during
tribal counsel this week?&quot;. Each correct answer to each bonus question is
awarded 10 points.<ul>
<li>See 18.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Assign a first place player, a second place player and third place player.
The first place player gets 60% of the amount of money, the second place
player gets 30% of the amount of money and the third place person gets 10%
of the amount of money.<ul>
<li>Generated in backend upon advancing to the end of the game. This
information is displayed in the general tab upon completion of the game
under the &quot;winners&quot; panel.</li>
</ul>

<li>At any time the admin user should be able to get all the players picks for a
given week/round. This would normally be done by writing to the internet but
because of issues with FTP, you can read and write to the C: drive (both
parts of the project will be tested on the same machine with the same c:
